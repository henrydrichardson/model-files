**Custom Ollama Model Files Repository**
=====================================

Welcome to the repository dedicated to storing and sharing custom Ollama model files. The goal is to provide a private space for myself to showcase, share, and collaborate on custom models that can be used to improve workflows or simply for fun! Considerations for expanding this repository to a community-driven space will be considered if a signifiant interest is present.

**What are Custom Ollama Models?**
--------------------------------

Ollama models are pre-trained machine learning models that can be fine-tuned and customized for specific tasks. By creating and sharing custom Ollama models, users can tailor their models to meet the unique requirements of their projects, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency.

**Repository Purpose**
-------------------

This repository serves as a central hub for storing and showcasing custom Ollama model files. We encourage contributors to upload their own custom models, share knowledge on how they were created, and engage with others in the community to learn from their experiences.

**How Can I Contribute?**
------------------------

To contribute to this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new branch**: Start by creating a new branch based on the current `main` branch.
2. **Add your custom model**: Upload your custom Ollama model file and include any relevant documentation or notes about its creation.
3. **Share your knowledge**: Write a brief description of how you created your custom model, including any insights or best practices you'd like to share with the community.

**Repository Structure**
------------------------

The repository is organized into the following directories:

* `models`: This directory contains all uploaded custom Ollama models
* `docs`: This directory holds documentation and notes about each custom model, as well as any relevant information about their creation.

**How Can I Use These Custom Models?**
-------------------------------------

To use the custom models stored in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Download a model**: Select a custom Ollama model file from the `models` directory and download it to your local machine.
2. [Create the local model with Ollama!](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#create-a-model)

**Community Guidelines**
-----------------------

To ensure a positive and productive community experience, please follow these guidelines:

* **Respect others' work**: When sharing or using custom models, be mindful of their intellectual property and give credit where due.
* **Be open and transparent**: Share your knowledge and experiences with the community to help others learn from your successes and mistakes.

By contributing to this repository, you're helping to build a community-driven space for sharing and learning about custom Ollama model files. Thank you for being part of this project!
